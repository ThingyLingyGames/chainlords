## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the docs with any new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations
3. Increase version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version
4. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of maintainers
